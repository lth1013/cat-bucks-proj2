# User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create an account using the sign up page, so that I can have a unique account where my data is stored.

- As a user, I want to be able to log in and save my session. So that the website can remember my cart and cat bucks.

- As a user, I want to be able to purchase the items, and have them shipped to me. So that I can spend my cat bucks and receive my item.

- As a user, I want to be able to end my session and logout. So that the website will not have my data and my session will end.

## Learning Points

1. We learned a very easy to use and fun to implement introJs.

2. We are getting a better understanding of handlebars and how to link different files to them since they don't go by normal file paths.
